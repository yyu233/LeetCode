## Thoughts ##
1. Solved subarray problems.   
2. Realize that solutions to some progamming probem have the pattern of referring historical value back and forth.   
3. Initial approach to problem try to avoid auxillary space. If solution is not found, then think about using auxillary space.
4. For iteration, where to start, where to stop. When to update variables, when not to update variables.
