## Thoughts ##

1. Solved subarray problems.   
2. Realize that solutions to some progamming probem have the pattern of referring historical value back and forth.   
3. Initial approach to problem try to avoid auxillary space. If solution is not found, then think about using auxillary space.
4. For iteration, where to start, where to stop. When to update variables, when not to update variables. (Try to treat it as a FSM. Every state is a snapshot. What are the values the program should produce at each state?)
5. For data structure processing, divide the data structure into a processed part and unprocessed part. Processed part has information what we have already known so far. It's like looking backward and forward. 
6. Top-down recursion vs Bottom-up recursion. 

## Common Strategy ## 

1. Sliding Window
2  Pointers or Iterators
3. Fast and Slow Pointers or Iterators
4. Merge Intervals
5. Cyclic sort
6. In-place reversal of linked list
7. Tree BFS
8. Tree DFS
9. Two heaps
10. Subsets
11. Modified binary search
12. Top K elements
13. K-way merge
14. Topological sort
