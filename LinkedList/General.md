## General ## 

1. Single link or Double link
2. 1 slow pointer 1 faster pointer 
3. stack, recursion for single link 
4. How many pointers do we need? How much distance should every pointer move during each interaction? 
5. When need to remove nodes from list, do we remove the head of list? How to not lose the reference of a list? Should we use a dummy head? 
6. Reversing is equivalent to swapping the two end nodes. 
7. Linked lists are flexible to merge. 
8. Deep copy -> dummy head
