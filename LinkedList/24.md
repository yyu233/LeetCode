1. What prerequisite conditions we need to make swap happen? We need at least 2 nodes. So 0 node and 1 node are edge cases.
2. Think about general case: ``` ... -> a -> b -> .... ```
3. To swap a and b, we need a buffer to memorize b.next. Let's name it tmp. 
4. Now, we can safely change b to point to a.
5. But we have a cycle: a -> b and b -> a. So update a.next
6. 2 cases: a.next -> tmp or a.next -> tmp.next. Second case can only happen when tmp is not null and tmp.next is not null
7. Now we have the solution for general case, we miss the case for the 1st iteraton of loop: ``` head -> a -> b -> ... ```
8. We have two pointers left, right. Preset them to point at a and b respectively. Now upate head to point to b.
