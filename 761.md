### Analyse the quesiton and filter out unimportant information ###      

* **Magical string**:  
  1. Equal number of bit 1 and 0 .   
  2. Prefix has no less bit 1 than 0 and starts with 1
  * **Magical string can contain magical substring**
  * **Swap consecutive magical substrings to form lexicographically largest magical string**
    
### Decompose the problem ###

Max(s<sub> i...n-1 </sub>) = Max(s<sub>i...j</sub>) + Max(s<sub>j+1 ... n-1</sub>)

### Recognize pattern ###

If S is a magical string, then it must have equal number of bit 1 and 0. It must also start with 1 and end with 0, because the base case 1001 is not a magical string. Then we can write S as a concatenation of 1M0.   
M must be a magical string because the total number of bits of S is even, the number of bit 1 and 0 is equal, and even - the first bit 1 and the last bit 0 is also an even number.
Also if the prefix of M has more bit 0 than 1, then the first bit 1 and this prefix will form a magical string and is found before 1M0.
We can treat M as a subprolem.

### Algorithm ###

1. Since we need to find  Max(s<sub>i...j</sub>) and  Max(s<sub>j+1 ... n-1</sub>), we need a data structure to memorize the previous value, do the comparison and sort. 
2. Traverse and search for magical string. Treat this magical string as a subprolem and repeat search and sort process.
