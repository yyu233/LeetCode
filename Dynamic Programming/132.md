1.  assume we know the index range for each sub-palindrome. (by dp)
2.  cut at i, and from 0 - i is a sub-palindrome
3.  cut[i] stores the minimum number of cut for 0 - i
4.  cut[i] = (the minimum number of cut within 0 - i) + 1; 1 is the cut we made at i
5.  we can find the minimum number of cut within 0 - 1 iteratively (subproblem)
