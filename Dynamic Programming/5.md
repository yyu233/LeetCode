1. recurrence: ```P(i, j) = if (Char(i) == Char(j) && P(i + 1, j - 1) ```
2. since i depends on i + 1, we fill up the table from bottom to up
3. since j depens on j - 1, we fill up the table from left to right
4. since i is the index marking the left boundary, and j is the index marking the right boundary, then i must be i <= j
5. base case, i = j and i + 1 = j
