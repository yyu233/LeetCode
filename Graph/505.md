1. When we have paths reached an arbitary point  
What should we do?   
Each path will carry accumulated path length  
Compare each path value with the memory stored at the current point, and we update
the memory with the shortest length  

2. How can we make state transition happen (make search get closer to our target)?    
Traverse by depth or traverse by level
