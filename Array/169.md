## Moore's voting algorithm ## 

When applying the algorithm on an array, only one of below two cases can happen (Let C be the element of our first candidate):

A. C’s counter never drops to zero through out the array, or;

B. C’s counter drops to zero at some point (reset point).

Let’s think of the counter as “number of C we’ve seen so far MINUS number of non-C we’ve seen so far”.

If A, then apparently our candidate is the majority;

If B, then (let’s say array has n elements, at reset point we have seen x elements):

  |__arr_seen__|______arr_todo______|            
If there exists a real majority element M, who has never appeared in arr_seen i.e. before the reset point, then M must still be the majority in arr_todo — Just do it again on arr_todo;

If M has appeared in arr_seen, it must have appeared only up to x/2 times (Why? Since C’s counter is zero, if C happens to be M, then it’s exactly x/2 times; If C is not M, M must have appeared fewer or equal times than C has). We know in original array we have at least n/2 Ms, in arr_seen we have no more than x/2 Ms, therefore in arr_todo there exists at least (n/2 - x/2) Ms. To be more precise:

count_of_M >= floor(n/2) + 1 # +1 because majority is *greater* than half
M_in_arr_seen <= x/2 # x can only be even because counter is 0
M_in_arr_todo = (count_of_M - M_in_arr_seen)
>= floor(n/2) + 1 - x/2
= floor(n-x)/2 + 1
and length of arr_todo is n-x, so M must still be the majority in it — Just do it all over again on arr_todo.

And there we have it like a recursive function. Note that this is when there IS a majority (more than half) in the array. When there's no majority, this process will give you a wrong answer, that's why you always have to do a second pass to check.
