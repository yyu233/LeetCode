1. Goal: Time O(n)
2. Implies linear scan
3. If we want to solve it in one pass, that implies at arbitary point, we should compute the global maximum (in this question, which is global longest consecutive sequence). First we want to find the answer from this point and then compete with the previous global maximum. If this arbitary point we visited before (overlapping), we don't want to compute again. To determine if it is visited, we check if any number we scanned before is smaller(always construct from the smallest number). To know this information, we need to know all the numbers in the array. That implies we can't do it in one pass. The first pass should give us all the numbers in the array. We construct global maximum of arbitary point in second pass.
