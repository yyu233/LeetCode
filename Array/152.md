1. think about the state when iterator points at nums[i], we have the prefix max, if prefix max * nums[i] >= nums[i], then prefix max  * nums[i] is the new prefix max. otherwise, nums[i] is the new prefix sum. Is it correct?
2. from a case: prefix max < 0, nums[i] > 0, prefix max * nums[i] < nums[i], new prefix sum is nums[i],  but what if nums[i + 1] < 0? So equaton 1 does not cover all cases. It is not correct
3. from the above case, we also need to cover the case when the prefix part is negative to make the equation from point 1 complete. 
we need compare prefix max with prefix minimum.
