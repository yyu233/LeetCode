## Thoughts on myfvcat123 solution ##

1. list all the cases: 
   * L1 and L2 same length with intersection
   * L1 and L2 same length without intersection
   * L1 and L2 different length with intersection
   * L1 and L2 different length without intersection
2. For same length cases, we can find a result in one pass. For different length case, we can't because iterators for L1 and L2 are unsynchronized. 
3. if we can find a result for different length cases in one pass, can we find in another pass? Can we make the two iterators synchronized in second pass?
4. if L1 and L2 different length and intersect, the length difference is the unintersected part of L1 and L2.

```
eg: 
First pass  
                  itr1
                    |
L1： 0 0 0 
             2 2 2 null
L2:  1 1 1 1
                 |
                itr2

Second pass， at the start, we want the iterators to be like this, can we achieve it somehow? 
    itr1
     |
L1： 0 0 0  
             2 2 2 null
L2   1 1 1 1
       |
      itr2
      

we can do this after 1st pass of L1: 
           
           
L1： 0 0 0 
             2 2 2 null
L2:  1 1 1 1
     |               |
    itr1            itr2
    
After the 1st pass of L2:

   itr2
     |
L1： 0 0 0 
             2 2 2 null
L2:  1 1 1 1
       |
      itr1


This means that since L2 is longer than L1, we add some offest to itr1 to make it ahead of itr2 at the second pass. 
```

5. We can then prove the correctness of this solution by running through all cases.
