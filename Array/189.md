## Some thoughts ##
1. How many variables we need to use for swapping elements of array and the order of assign variable values?
2. Think about the number of loops and the number of rotations (Is there a repeat pattern? Can we optimize the number of iterations?)
3. How can we make sure our algorithm works before implementing it? Is there a restriction to make this algorithm valid? (Specifically for this quesiton, after *a* iterations, iterator variable *i* could end up at the beginning index (cyle), and there are elements not swapped after *i*. This will pose a problem and should be taken care by the implementation)
4. Writing a loop is equilavent to finite state machine. (Try to represent the state of all variables at each iteration). Think about when iteration completes.
