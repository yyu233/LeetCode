1. First thought: brute force, scan from left to right
2. How to eliminate repetition?
3. Recognize subproblem: result for [i ... j] depends on [i+1 ... j]
4. if nums[i + 1] > nums[i], the first larger number for i is nums[i+1]; if n not, the first larger number for i + 1 might be a candidate; if not, keep searching from left to right and we don't want the first larger number for i + 1 anymore. 
5. point 4 indicates, we may grow the range of search from right to left. As we need the first larger element for element we searched before, that indicates we need an extra space to memorize. As we need the action to ignore or remove first larger number for previous search, that indicates the data structure might be stack or queue.
